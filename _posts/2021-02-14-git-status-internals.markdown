For [win-git-status], I reached the point where I wanted to compare the
working tree files to the git index. I understood that git used [sha1] for
versioning the contents of files, as well as other parts of a git repo (the
"internals" chapter of the [git-book] discusses the use of [sha1] better.).
So I decided to try and perform the [sha1] hash on every file in the working
tree. The time to hash quickly became a large bottle neck. I was using
[0f9f0a40] from the [llvm-project] which had 97912 files. I killed the
process after 30 seconds. `git status` only takes 0.340 seconds when run on
the commit [0f9f0a40].

I had mentioned in [Efficientlly Walking File Directories in Rust]({% post_url 2021-02-13-walking-file-directories-in-rust %})
how I should look into the actual `git status` implementation, it seemed that
now was the time.

How [libgit2] Does Status
=========================

I already had a clone of version `1.1.0` of [libgit2] available and built.
[libgit2] provides an example [status] command that provides basic `git
status` functionality, but doesn't fully mimic it. With the [libgit2]
examples built I was able to debug how the command worked.

I created a simple repo with one file:

    mkdir simple_repo
    cd simple_repo
    git init
    echo "some text" > foo.txt
    git add foo.txt
    git commit -m "commiting one file"

This simple repo allowed be to minimize the debugging effort. I mean who
want's to walk through 90k file entries?

Git File Hashing Detour
-----------------------

Since I had the repo created with minimal values I decided to test out my
understanding of how file contents are hashed. I know that on windows
machines, one usually has [core.autocrlf] set to `true` and this setting can
affect the hash. I had intentionally not put any kind of line continuation in
the example file `foo.txt` so I should be able to avoid that nuance.

To test out my understanding I first determined what git said the hash was.
(If I did the example correctly you should get the same result.):

    $ git ls-tree HEAD
    100644 blob 7b57bd29ea8afbdeb9bac64cf7074f4b531492a8    foo.txt

So git hashed the file to `7b57bd29ea8afbdeb9bac64cf7074f4b531492a8`. I next
tried to hash the file directly:

    $ sha1sum foo.txt
    a5c341bec5c89ed16758435069e3124b3685ad93 *foo.txt

Clearly these aren't the same hash. Scratching my head for a bit I decided to
hash the object that git had stored.  

Git will store objects in `.git/objects`. The first 2 characters of the hash
value will be the directory and the remaning will be the stored object. The
objects are stored in a compressed format so if one `cat`s them or similar it
will be binary gibberish.

    $ sha1sum .git/objects/7b/57bd29ea8afbdeb9bac64cf7074f4b531492a8
    4513c89020c6f389db9e7ad6523a2d4fd2805ede *.git/objects/7b/57bd29ea8afbdeb9bac64cf7074f4b531492a8

So now I'm left with neither the raw file nor the stored object matching the
hash that git reports it as. At this point I did some googling and found that
git stores a header with object and that's included in the hash. Really I
should have just re-read the [git objects][git-objects] section of the
[git-book] as it says it plain as day.

> Git concatenates the header and the original content and then calculates
the SHA-1 checksum of that new content.

So to test this out I edited foo.txt to include the header:

    $ echo -e "blob 10\0some text" > foo.txt
    $ sha1sum foo.txt
    7b57bd29ea8afbdeb9bac64cf7074f4b531492a8 *foo.txt

Victory!!! At least now I'm more familiar with how git is hashing files.

Debugging [libgit2]
-------------------

I wanted to debug how [libgit2] was able to hash so many files so fast, when
I had to kill my process after 30 seconds, with no end in sight.

When debugging anything, I usually try to start at one end or the other of
the execution path. I'm familiar enough with [libgit2] that I knew
[git_status_list_new()] was going to be the start of the status logic. I felt
that the start of the execution path might be too broad of an area to focus
on. So instead I search for `sha` in the [libgit2] repo and found
`git_hash_sha1_update()`. `git_hash_sha1_update()` has multiple
implementations depending on compiler settings/platform so I decided to set a
breakpoint in `git_hash_update()` where it called `git_hash_sha1_update()` to
ensure I didn't miss the occurence.

{% highlight c %}
int git_hash_update(git_hash_ctx *ctx, const void *data, size_t len)
{
    switch (ctx->algo) {
        case GIT_HASH_ALGO_SHA1:
            return git_hash_sha1_update(&ctx->sha1, data, len); // breakpoint here
        default:
            assert(0);
            return -1;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

With the break point set it was time to debug. Looking at the call stack of
the first few hits, it appeared to be the config file, so seemed irrelevant.

![git_hash_update() callstack](/assets/libgit2_hash_callstack.png)

It wasn't until the 5th time hitting the breakpoint that it looked like a
possibility.

![git_hash_update() callstack](/assets/libgit2_object_hash.png)

Looking more closely at the call stack one can see the function
[git_reference_peel()]. Jumping to the invokation location one can see:

{% highlight c %}
    if ((error = git_reference_peel(&obj, head, GIT_OBJECT_TREE)) < 0)
        goto cleanup;
{% endhighlight %}

This doesn't look like the hashing of `foo.txt` it appears to be looking up
the tree for the current head. I let the break point advance a couple more
times and hit an instance where it looked like the behavior was looking up
the current commit.  Then the process just finished.

I was at a loss, [libgit2] never seemed to be hashing `foo.txt` during the
status operation. So how did [libgit2] know if `foo.txt` was modified or not?

### Jumping to the Other Side of the Execution

Since it appeared that [libgit2] was never hashing the on disk version of
`foo.txt`, it was time to figure out what [libgit2] was doing to compare the
on disk version to the repo version.

Scrutinizing [git_status_list_new()], there is a call to
[git_index_to_work_dir()]. This seemed like a likely candidate to debug into.
Inside [git_index_to_work_dir()] there is a block that looks to actually
perform the comparison between the index and workdir, by use of
[git_diff__from_iterators()].

{% highlight c %}
    if ((error = diff_prepare_iterator_opts(&prefix, &a_opts, GIT_ITERATOR_INCLUDE_CONFLICTS,
                &b_opts, GIT_ITERATOR_DONT_AUTOEXPAND, opts)) < 0 ||
        (error = git_iterator_for_index(&a, repo, index, &a_opts)) < 0 ||
        (error = git_iterator_for_workdir(&b, repo, index, NULL, &b_opts)) < 0 ||
        (error = git_diff__from_iterators(&diff, repo, a, b, opts)) < 0)
        goto out;
{% endhighlight %}

It may be good to stop and discuss a little bit about how
[git_diff__from_iterators()] appears to work. It looks like it compares the
sorted version of each directory in the index and working tree. This sorted
approach allows it to quickly see when a file is extra in the index or the
working tree. When a file exists in the index, but not in the working tree,
it is in a delted state. When a file exists in the working tree but not the
index, it is in an untracked.

The important code block to notice in [git_diff__from_iterators()] is when a
file name exists in both the index and working tree.

{% highlight c %}
        /* otherwise item paths match, so create MODIFIED record
         * (or ADDED and DELETED pair if type changed)
         */
        else
            error = handle_matched_item(diff, &info);
{% endhighlight %}

Debugging into `handle_matched_item()` one quickly walks into
[maybe_modifed()]. [maybe_modified()] was the function I was looking for. I
probably walked the debugger through this function 10 times with `foo.txt`
not modified and it modified in different ways to try and understand what was
going on.  

The important thing to take away here is the following clause: 

{% highlight c %}
    /* if we have an unknown OID and a workdir iterator, then check some
     * circumstances that can accelerate things or need special handling
     */
    } else if (git_oid_is_zero(&nitem->id) && new_is_workdir) {
{% endhighlight %}

The `OID` is "Object ID" it's usually the hash value of an object. So when
one is comparing the working tree (workdir iterator) one doesn't know what
the `OID` is. If one looks further in that condition you can see that it
compares the file metadate of the index version and the working tree version.
And only if there is an `mtime` change, or similar, with the same file size
will a working version of the file actually get hashed.

How Git Does Status
===================

I didn't debug how git itself compares files for the `git status` operation.
After what I discovered debugging [libgit2], I decided to just quickly jump
around the git code base looking for what appeared to be similar logic as
[libgit2]. I eventually found [diff_filespec_check_stat_unmatch()]. This
function looks to be doing similar logic by comparing file size and mode.

Summary
=======

My assumption that `git status` was hashing the working directory files in
order to compare them to the index was completely incorrect. Git will take
the more optimil approach and initially compare the file metadata. Only when
the file size is the same and the other metadata is different will git
perform a hash on a working tree version of a file.

As mentioned in [Efficientlly Walking File Directories in Rust]({% post_url 2021-02-13-walking-file-directories-in-rust %}),
I'm looking at using [jwalk]. [jwalk] parallelizes per directory. If I do it
correctly I should be able to use a similar directory comparison as [libgit2]
while on those separate threads. Not sure if that will provide any extra
speed up, but it may actually be the simpler implementation.
