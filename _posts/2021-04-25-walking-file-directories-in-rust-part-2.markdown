This post is meant to follow on from [Efficientlly Walking File Directories
in Rust]({% post_url 2021-02-13-walking-file-directories-in-rust %}) and 
correct some innaccuracies in [Speeding Up File
Modification Time Lookup on Windows]({% post_url
2021-03-03-speeding-up-windows-file-status-lookup %}).

The overall goal of the 2 mentioned posts was to find an efficient way to
get the file modification times for all the files in a directory tree.

Only Look Once
==============

It took me a bit to realize, but the logic I was using was actually walking
the directory structure twice:

1. [jwalk] was used as a threaded way to get the names and types of each file
   in each directory.
2. [NtQueryDirectoryFile] was used to get the modification times of the files
   that were provided by [jwalk].

File I/O is generally slower than most other CPU processing. So in general
only walking a directory once should show a decent improvement.  

Accessing the files in each directory twice was happening becuase a direct
call to get a file's modified time via [std::fs::modified()][modified] showed
a significant time cost.  I double checked that [jwalk] itself didn't happen
to propagate the modified time.  One can see that the
[jwalk::DirEntry::from_entry()][DirEntry] method copies some fields from the
``std::fs::DirEntry`` struct, but it happens to omit the `metadata`, which
contains the modified time.

With the realization that the use of [jwalk] was causing me to go to the file
system twice I decided to re-visit the topic of [Efficientlly Walking File
Directories in Rust]({% post_url 2021-02-13-walking-file-directories-in-rust
%})

Directory Walking (with examples)
=================================

With a bit more knowledge in rust and with my desire to better back up my
understanding with metrics I created,
[https://github.com/speedyleion/rust_directory_walking](https://github.com/speedyleion/rust_directory_walking).
This provides a simple executable that times the walking of directories using
different approaches.

```
   $ directory_walking.exe llvm-project
   The jwalk time 163.6281ms, and the files 107593
   The ntquery_walk_dir time 185.8282ms, and the files 108404
   The walk_dir_path_is_dir time 638.7077ms, and the files 108450
   The walk_dir time 631.5173ms, and the files 108450
   The walk_dir_threaded time 147.7341ms, and the files 108451
```

This was a run against the [llvm-project] using commit [0f9f0a40].

* `jwalk` is using the [jwalk] crate.
* `ntquery_walk_dir` is my attempt at leveraging [NtQueryDirectoryFile], as I
  documented in [Speeding Up File Modification Time Lookup on Windows]({% post_url 2021-03-03-speeding-up-windows-file-status-lookup %}).
  More on this later.
* `walk_dir_path_is_dir` is using the basic example provided in the rust docs
  for [std::fs::read_dir()][read_dir]
* `walk_dir` slightly modifies the [std::fs::read_dir()][read_dir]
  example to use `is_dir()` from [std::fs::FileType].  More on this later.
* `walk_dir_threaded` is utilizing [rayon::scope] to provide threading around
  [std::fs::read_dir()][read_dir].

And a nice table form:

| method | Time (ms) | directory entries |
| ------- | ---- |------|
| `jwalk` | 163.6281 | 107593 |
| `ntquery_walk_dir` | 185.8282 | 108404 |
| `walk_dir_path_is_dir` | 638.7077 | 108450 |
| `walk_dir` | 631.5173 | 108450 |
| `walk_dir_threaded` | 147.7341 | 108451 |

The timings fluctuate a little bit and these are just a snapshot of one run.
The directory entry differences are based on how naivly the different
implementations may or may not ignore dot files.

ntquery_walk_dir
----------------

The results of this version contradicts many of my claims made in
[Speeding Up File Modification Time Lookup on Windows]({% post_url 2021-03-03-speeding-up-windows-file-status-lookup %}).

I double checked the implementation of [std::fs::read_dir()][read_dir] in
the hopes that maybe it was using [NtQueryDirectoryFile] on the backend and
was just more efficient than my attempt.  However looking in the rust 
[source code][ReadDir] it looks to be using [FindNextFileW].

I did some more research to see if perhaps I was completly misunderstanding
[NtQueryDirectoryFile] and what it could do:

* [https://github.com/chromium/vs-chromium/issues/58](https://github.com/chromium/vs-chromium/issues/58)
  Claims ~40% improvement over [FindNextFileW].
* [https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/commit/b69c08c338403a3f8fd2394180664cb9f8164c78](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/commit/b69c08c338403a3f8fd2394180664cb9f8164c78)
  which claims an 18% improvement over the [FindNextFileW].

In the end it seems that some people have seen aperformance benefit.  I'm
attributing the slowdown due to something in my attempt.  Perhaps using
inefficient conversion logic for the file name.

walk_dir_path_is_dir
--------------------

It doesn't really show it in these results.  In fact sometimes it will report
faster than `walk_dir`.  However on some windows systems I've noticed
significant performance penalties when walking directories and using
[std::path::Path::is_dir()][is_dir].  On one system in particular, I saw
timings for [win-git-status] going from 1.2 seconds, using
[std::path::Path::is_dir()][is_dir], down to 500ms by using `is_dir` from
[std::fs::FileType].  Going from memory I believe this was ~80k files.  This
was on a system with a spinning disk and a bit of security software.  The
timings reported above are on an SSD with a bit less security.

In general it's probably better to access the
[file_type()][std::fs::FileType] of directory entries provided by [read_dir].

walk_dir_threaded
-----------------

I was a bit surprised that just a basic [rayon::scope] around [read_dir]
outperforms [jwalk].  In [jwalk]'s defense, it is a generic threaded
directory walking implementation.  And [jwalk] clearly outperforms the single
threaded `walk_dir` appraoch.  Using [rayon::scope] around [read_dir], one is
more likely to write a specific implementation that isn't as portable or
reusable.

From the documentation on [fs::DirEntry::metadata()][metadata]:

> On Windows this function is cheap to call (no extra system calls needed),
but on Unix platforms this function is the equivalent of calling
symlink_metadata on the path.

This means that there is no extra cost, on windows, to getting the file
modification times when using [read_dir] directly.

Summary
=======

Based on the timings, my naive implementation of walking directories twice to
compare modification times resulted in 349.4563ms (163.6281 + 185.8282) just
walking through the files.  Updating to use `walk_dir_threaded` only costs
147.7341ms or an improvement of ~55%.

This improvment was clearly seen when running [win-git-status] against
the [llvm-project] at commit [0f9f0a40]. The time went from ~770ms to
~570ms
